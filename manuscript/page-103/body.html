UTTERSON was sitting by his fireside one evening after dinner, when he was surprised to receive a visit from Poole.</p><p>"Bless me, Poole, what brings you here?" he cried; and then taking a second look at him, "What ails you?" he added; "is the doctor ill?"</p><p>"Mr. Utterson," said the man, "there is something wrong."</p><p>"Take a seat, and here is a glass of wine for you," said the lawyer. "Now, take your time, and tell me plainly what you want."</p><p>"You know the doctor's ways, sir," replied Poole, "and how he shuts himself up. Well, he's shut up again in the cabinet; and I don't like it, sirâ€”I wish I may die if I like it. Mr. Utterson, sir, I'm afraid."</p></div> </div>
