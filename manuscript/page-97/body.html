We shall never see more of Mr. Hyde."</p><p>"I hope not," said Utterson. "Did I ever tell you that I once saw him, and shared your feeling of repulsion?"</p><p>"It was impossible to do the one without the other," returned Enfield. "And by the way, what an ass you must have thought me, not to know that this was a back way to Dr. Jekyll's! It was partly your own fault that I found it out, even when I did."</p></div> </div>
